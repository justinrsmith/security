Raspi Security

A simple project to create an 'alert and view' system using the
offical Raspberry Pi camera board and the motion (mmal) package,
created by Raspberry Pi user 'dozencrows'.

*WARNING* Project makes use of Python3.3

What it does:
Once new detection is found the movement is recorded to a file. Upon this
the file is detected then sent off to a central computer for hosting and
an email is sent to the user alerting them of a new video.
